Diffuse coarseness (graininess) and glint impression (sparkle) are two aspects of visual perception for special-effect materials, including car finishes, etc. Previous work has shown that these two attributes become apparent when illuminated under two distinct illumination conditions: diffuse and unidirectional illumination respectively. The effect of glint impression has significant dependency on the viewing geometry. In this work, three psychophysical experiments were carried out, including diffuse coarseness assessment, glint impression assessment, and finding dimensions of glint space.<br/>
