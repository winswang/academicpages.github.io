Abstract: Recent advances in bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) acquisitions have provided a novel approach for appearance measurement and analysis. In particular, since gloss appearance is dependent on the directional reflective properties of surfaces, it is reasonable to leverage the BRDF for gloss evaluation. In this paper, we investigate gloss appearance from both soft metrology and hard metrology. A psychophysical experiment was conducted for the gloss assessment of 47 neutral-color samples. In the evaluation of gloss perception from gloss meter measurements, we report several ambiguous correspondences in the medium gloss range. In order to analyze and explain this phenomenon, the BRDF was acquired and examined using a commercial BRDF measuring device. With an improved correlation-to-visual perception, we propose a two-dimensional gloss model by combining a parameter, the standard deviation of the specular lobe, from Wardâ€™s BRDF model with measured gloss values.

Abstract: Diffuse coarseness (graininess) and glint impression (sparkle) are two aspects of visual perception for special-effect materials, including car finishes, etc. Previous work has shown that these two attributes become apparent when illuminated under two distinct illumination conditions: diffuse and unidirectional illumination respectively. The effect of glint impression has significant dependency on the viewing geometry. In this work, three psychophysical experiments were carried out, including diffuse coarseness assessment, glint impression assessment, and finding dimensions of glint space.
