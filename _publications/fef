Abstract: Video frame synthesis is an active computer vision problem which has applications in video compression, streaming, editing, and understanding. In
this work, we present a computational high speed video synthesis framework. Our framework takes as inputs two types of data streams: an intensity frame stream
and a neuromorphic event stream, which consists of asynchronous bipolar "events" which encode brightness variations over time at over 1000 fps. We
introduce an algorithm to recover a space-time video from these two modes of observations. We factor the reconstruction into a physical model-based
reconstruction (PBR) process and a residual denoising process. We use a differentiable model to approximate the physical sensing process, which enables
stochastic gradient descent optimization using automatic differentiation. Residual errors in PBR reconstruction are further reduced by training a
residual denoiser to remove reconstruction artifacts. The video output from our reconstruction algorithm has both high frame rate and well-recovered spatial
features. Our framework is capable of handling challenging scenes that include fast motion and strong occlusions.<br/>
