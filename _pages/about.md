Hi there,

My name is Wang, Zihao (王子豪). Winston is my preferred name in the US and English-speaking world. I'm from [Anshan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anshan,+Liaoning,+China/@41.1163422,122.866278,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5e28b5d159b26c5d:0x7c815864a47d5bd9!8m2!3d41.108647!4d122.994329), northeastern China.

Current state
======
I am a research intern at Microsoft Research, Redmond (Jun-Aug 2018). 

I'm a PhD student (2015-present) in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I do research in computational imaging/photography. My advisor is [Prof. Ollie Cossairt](http://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/).

Biosketch
======
I was a research intern in Computational Imaging team at [Light](http://www.light.co) (Mar-Aug 2017), mentored by [Dr. Dikpal Reddy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zlQCFzkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I worked on camera calibration (geometric and spectral).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Optics in 2015 at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with Honors from [Chu Ko-chen Honors College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Kochen_Honors_College,_Zhejiang_University). During my undergrad, I worked with [Dr. Ming Ronnier Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iQ17HxkAAAAJ&hl=en) in color science. We studied how human eyes respond to surface effects, i.e. gloss, glint, graininess. In my senior year, I was lucky to visit [Dr. George Barbastathis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4rsJDwUAAAAJ&hl=en) and did some research in light transport simulation for gradient index (GRIN) lens.
