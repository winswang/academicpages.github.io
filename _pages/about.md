Hi there,

My name is Wang, Zihao (王子豪). Winston is my preferred name in the US and English-speaking world. I'm from [Anshan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anshan,+Liaoning,+China/@41.1163422,122.866278,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5e28b5d159b26c5d:0x7c815864a47d5bd9!8m2!3d41.108647!4d122.994329), northeastern China.

Current state
======
I am a PhD student (2015-present, qualified in 2018 Spring) in Computer Science at Northwestern University. I do research in computational photography and video. My advisor is [Dr. Ollie Cossairt](http://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/).

Experiences
======
From late March to mid August 2017, I was a research intern in Computational Imaging team at [Light](http://www.light.co). My supervisor was [Dr. Dikpal Reddy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zlQCFzkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I worked on geometric and spectral calibration.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Optics in 2015 at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with Honors from [Chu Ko-chen Honors College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Kochen_Honors_College,_Zhejiang_University). In CKC, I was lucky to have the opportunity to choose an academic advisor and design a tailored curricular program. I studied and did some research in color science from [Dr. Ming Ronnier Luo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=iQ17HxkAAAAJ&hl=en). At the end of my undergraduate studies, I was lucky to visit [Dr. George Barbastathis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4rsJDwUAAAAJ&hl=en) and did some research in GRadient INdex ray tracing using Hamiltonian and Wigner distribution function.
