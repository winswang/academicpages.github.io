Hi there,

My name is Wang, Zi-Hao (王子豪) and I go by Winston. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at Northwestern University, advised by [Ollie Cossairt](http://compphotolab.northwestern.edu/people/oliver-ollie-cossairt/). My research interests include computer vision and machine learning.

Previously I have interned at Apple, Microsoft Research, and [Light](http://www.light.co).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Optics in 2015 at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with Honors from [Chu Ko-chen Honors College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_Kochen_Honors_College,_Zhejiang_University). 

I was born in [Anshan](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anshan,+Liaoning,+China/@41.1163422,122.866278,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5e28b5d159b26c5d:0x7c815864a47d5bd9!8m2!3d41.108647!4d122.994329), northeastern China.
